Streamflow in the Columbia River Basin: Quantifying Changes Over the Period 1951‚Äê2008 and Determining the Drivers of Those Changes

Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge (RAPID) is a matrix based river routing model.

My concern is how to map ELM runoff to RAPID because the scales of these two models are very different. ELM is usually at 50km to 100km and RAPID might be around 100m. If the resolutions are different, great uncertainty might be introduced.
