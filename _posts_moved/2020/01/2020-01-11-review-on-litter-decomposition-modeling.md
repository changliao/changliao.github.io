Litter decomposition involves series of processes.

Hydrological control nearly occurs throughout the whole decomposition process. As a result, if there is water-soluble materials in the litter, the leaching will take them out.

The water-soluble materials include Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC).

Also some particulate materials (Particulate Organic Carbon (POC), etc.) may leach out.
