In most aquifer test, the hydraulic conductivity is a function of the material, but it does not explicitly consider the impact of ice content on K.
When soil or any material is partially or fully frozen, its actual K will decrease significantly. Here I want to explore how to model this impact in soil hydrology model. Special attention will be paid to the different impacts on vertical and horizontal K, respectively.
