First, in mountain area, there is generally less groundwater observations, 
which makes it's difficult to define the boundary condition. Without 
observations, the initial head can only be assumed or estimated using a steady 
state simulation. 
Second, groundwater recharge in mountain area is very low. This is because 
some mountain surface has no soil or a shallow soil layer. And the 
permeability of rock fractures is very low. As a result, infiltration from the 
surface/subsurface to groundwater systems is extremely low. 
Third, the hydraulic priorities of the fractured and unfractured rock material 
are also very low, which means the groundwater system is very sensitive. 
Beside, topography effects from mountain area usually require high spatial 
resolution grid cell in the numerical simulation.
