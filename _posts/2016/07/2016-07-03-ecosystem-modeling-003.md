[Vadose zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadose_zone) is a critical 
component in ecosystem modeling. This is mainly because a lot of important 
processes occur within this zone. 
The location of vadose zone can be best illustrated by: 


In ecosystem modeling, most of the carbon/water dynamics are simulated within 
this zone. 
First, due to that the soil water is unsaturated, a modified Richard equation 
must be used to simulate the 3D water flow. However, currently, most modeling 
work usually only consider the one-dimensional water flow. 
Second, soil thermal is usually simulated since most processes are influenced 
by soil temperature dynamics. 
Third, microbe activities and other chemical reactions are simulated in some 
scenarios.
