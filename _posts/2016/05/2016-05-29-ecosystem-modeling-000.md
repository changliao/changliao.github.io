Having a visual class dependency map could significantly help you to better 
understand the structure of a complex ecosystem model. For example, a group in 
University of Tennessee published a web-based [structure 
tree](http://web.ornl.gov/~7xw/CLM_Overview.html) of the Community Land Model. 

From the perspective of model development, a dependency map also increase your 
productivity and performance. 


There are many approach to produce such a map. For example, if you are using 
Visual Studio IDE in Windows environment, you can try the built-in 
[Architecture](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd409453.aspx)[ 
](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd409453.aspx)tool. And it will 
generate beautiful maps. 


If you prefer to use open source alternatives, you can try 
[Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/). It may be already installed 
in many Linux distributions. You can also use the Window version. 


Below is an example my current ecosystem model structure:

Doxygen also has lots of other features you can try out.
