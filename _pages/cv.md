Education
=========
* Ph.D. Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, Purdue University. 2017
* M.S. 
  * School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University. 2011  
  * Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Beijing. 2011
* B.S. School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, 2009

Work experience
===============

* 2020-Present: Earth Scientist
  * Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
  * Projects: 
    * Hillslope-based subsurface lateral groundwater flow model (H2SC) in the Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE)-Tropics project. 
    * Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) mesh-based flow routing model in DOE’s Integrated Coastal Modeling (ICoM) project. 
    * A unified mesh-based flow routing modeling in DOE’s Interdisciplinary Research for Arctic Coastal Environments (InteRFACE) project. 
* 2017-2020: Postdoc Associate
  * Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
  * Projects: 
    * Hillslope-based subsurface lateral groundwater flow model (H2SC) in the Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE)-Tropics project. This model is implemented within Department Of Energy (DOE)’s Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM).  
    * Hexagonal grid-based surface hydrology watershed delineation model (HexWatershed) in a Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project. This model resolves several long-standing issues in hydrology and closes the gap between watershed hydrology and global scale hydrology.
    * Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) mesh-based flow routing model in DOE’s Integrated Coastal Modeling (ICoM) project. This model provides a consistent framework to couple land, river and ocean using a unified mesh.
    * Pollutant transport using integrated surface water and groundwater model simulation (SWAT-MODFLOW-MT3D). 
  * Supervisor: L. Ruby Leung
* 2012-2017: Research Assistant
  * Purdue University
  * Projects: 
    * Three-dimensional water and carbon cycle modeling at high spatial-temporal resolutions.
    * Quantifying the role of permafrost and snowmelt in arctic hydrology using integrated surface water and groundwater modeling.
    * Estimates of reduction of global plant production due to drought impacts.
  * Supervisor: Qianlai Zhuang

* 2009-2011: Research Assistant
  * Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research
  * Projects:
    * The integrated assessment system of the grassland ecosystem in the Three-River Headwaters region.
    * Estimates of photosynthesis active radiation using remote sensing data.
  * Supervisor: Quanqin Shao
