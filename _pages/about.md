I am an Earth scientist in the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

The objective of my research is to establish operational and flexible frameworks to investigate and predict the water and carbon cycle dynamics under the changing climate. 

My research interests include:
* Integrated/three-dimensional water, carbon, and nutrients cycle modeling; 
* Integrated surface water and groundwater modeling;
* Artificial intelligence (AI) in land surface modeling;
* Ecosystem modeling; and
* Snow dynamics and permafrost degradation.
