A common deficiency of current state of the art global climate models and 
Earth System Models (ESMs) is the simulation of dry biases over various 
continental regions. While part of the biases originate from remote or coupled 
atmosphere-ocean processes and deficits of the ESMs, part of the biases are 
related to shortcomings in the simulation of land surface hydrology.
