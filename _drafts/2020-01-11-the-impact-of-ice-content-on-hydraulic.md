In most aquifer test, the hydraulic conductivity is a function of the 
material, but it does not explicitly consider the impact of ice content on K. 
<div>When soil or any material is partially or fully frozen, its actual K will 
decrease significantly. Here I want to explore how to model this impact in 
soil hydrology model. Special attention will be paid to the different impacts 
on vertical and horizontal K, respectively.<div>
