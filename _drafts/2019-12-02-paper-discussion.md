Recently I started a series to discuss my own publications. The problem is I 
only have limited publications. 

So I decided to start a new series: paper discussion of others' publications. 

At PNNL, I have co-chaired the YSPD for one year and received lots of 
feedbacks on paper discussions. I think it might help other researchers as 
well. 

Here are some guidelines: 

1. I will only provide comments on papers I was not a reviewer so it in 
unofficial and not credential. 
1. I will be straightforward if possible. 
1. I may also comments on models and method.
