Whatever version of MODFLOW you are using for groundwater modeling, knowing 
how to make use of the list file can help a lot to understand what you are 
actually doing. 
<div> 
As the official MODFLOW manual document describes: 
"The Listing File is a key file to which model output is written. As MODFLOW 
runs, information is written to the Listing File, including much of the input 
data (as a record of the simulation) and calculated results." 
And 
<div><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"The Listing File includes a summary of 
the <span style="font-size: 11pt;">input data read for all packages. In 
addition, the Listing File optionally contains calculated head and drawdown 
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">controlled by layer and time step, and the 
overall volumetric budget controlled by time step. The Listing File also <span 
style="font-size: 11pt;">contains information about solver convergence and 
error messages. Output to other files can include head, <span 
style="font-size: 11pt;">drawdown, and cell-by-cell flow terms for use in 
calculations external to the model or in user-supplied applications <span 
style="font-size: 11pt;">such as plotting programs."<div style="orphans: auto; 
widows: 1;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> 
<div style="orphans: auto; widows: 1;"><span style="font-size: 
11pt;">Therefore, the Listing file actually contains a lot of important 
information.<div style="orphans: auto; widows: 1;">In my point of view, the 
Listing file is a critical way to examine some important variables and 
outputs. I will briefly talk about several usage of the Listing file with a 
few examples.<div style="orphans: auto; widows: 1;"> 
<div style="orphans: auto; widows: 1;">First, the Listing file can used to 
output all types of inputs in a readable way. MODFLOW provides several 
utilities to read different types of data. One of them would be real array 
data. However, a lot of time, even you have prepared the right data, it may 
not be in the right format or right order. The executable program will run 
anyway, but none of the inputs actually makes any sense. You probably are not 
aware of these types of situation at all. For example, you were supposed to 
input the initial head for three layers, and you mistakenly messed up the 
order of the layers. But the program will not give a red alert at all. 
However, if you output this inputs into the Listing file, it maybe very easy 
for you to catch this error. Another good example is that when have used 
specific storage (Ss) when the the specific yield (Sy) is needed. When you 
looked the Listing file, you can immediately pinpoint this issue. Again, the 
program will probably not complain when you gave a unusual value because it is 
still within the range.<div style="orphans: auto; widows: 1;"> 
<div style="orphans: auto; widows: 1;">Second, one of the most annoying parts 
of a successful MODFLOW simulation is the convergence. A lot of time has been 
wasted trying to converge. In fact, the Listing file contains very useful 
information for you to debug the problem. By looking at the convergence 
information, you can easily identify which cell is causing the problem and 
infer the reasons. You can also look at the volume changes of each terms (e.g. 
stream leakage) to identify the water balance issue. With appropriate 
adjustments, you can quickly improve the convergence efficiency using the 
water balance information.<div style="orphans: auto; widows: 1;">
