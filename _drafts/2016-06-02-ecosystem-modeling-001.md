Ecosystem modeling generally include three conceptual components: inputs, 
algorithm and outputs. 
For example, we usually need precipitation to estimate surface runoff. 
On the other hand, sometimes some outputs are also considered as inputs for 
other models. For example, vegetation dynamics also change the surface albedo 
and therefore the incoming radiation. 
In another word, the feedback among different processes are often too complex 
that we generally have to ignore some feedback processes. 

The reason is that our computer simulation MUST have a starting point and a 
sequence of algorithms in order to run the simulation. 
For some well-designed models, the differences between different starting 
points are not significant when using the numerical approach. However, it is a 
best practice to put all the algorithms in the right orders. 

For example, in surface hydrology, the generally order of the water flow is 
like this: 
precipitation-&gt;interception-&gt;snow-&gt;infiltration-&gt;overland 
runoff-&gt;stream flow, etc. In some case, groundwater also plays a role in 
this process. 
If you map these processes to the actual physical world, these processes occur 
in the following places: atmosphere-&gt;canopy-&gt;land 
surface-&gt;soil-&gt;stream channel. etc. 
Therefore, even though most of the processes occur simultaneously, we still 
need to break them down due to the time discretization scheme. If you have 
input data at a second resolution, following above order will not produce any 
different outputs compared with a different order. But if the time resolution 
is daily, monthly, or annually, the differences will increase significantly. 

Even though the algorithms are placed under a logic order such as water flow, 
how to design them in a computer program remains unclear. First, in most 
computer program developments, dependency relationship among components do not 
always reflect these logical orders. For example, a typical vegetation is 
consist of canopy, stem and root. However, processes occur in these parts are 
usually at different time scale and environmental conditions, which makes the 
dependency relationship of these processes are usually much distorted in 
computation programs. 

I will provide a real live example for review here: 
The[ Community Land Model](http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/tss/clm/) (CLM) is a widely 
used ecosystem model. 
The core part of the processes simulated has a following order in CLM 4.0.

On the left are the names of the processes or modules, on the right are brief 
description of them. It appears that the general workflow is from top to 
bottom. But the question remains unresolved, whether this is the appropriate 
order for all of these processes. For example, what if the albedo is estimated 
ahead of the soil flux since energy budget will be potentially different if 
albedo chanages from snow are considered.
