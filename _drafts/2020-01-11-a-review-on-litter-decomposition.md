Litter decomposition involves series of processes. 

Hydrological control nearly occurs throughout the whole decomposition process. 
As a result, if there is water-soluble materials in the litter, the leaching 
will take them out. 

The water-soluble materials include Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC). 

Also some particulate materials (Particulate Organic Carbon (POC), etc.) may 
leach out.
