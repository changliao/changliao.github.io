Recently I have been thinking about some philosophy in how model the real 
world.<div> 
<div>For many of us working on the Earth system model, we spent great efforts 
trying to understand the physical world. For example, we now have a reasonably 
good idea about how water flows within the system.  <div> 
<div>Based on our understanding of the physical laws, we built quite a few of 
process-based models to model and predict different types of systems.<div> 
<div>On the other hand, there are also processes that are not "simply" 
governed by physics. For example, human activities, or some stochastic 
processes like wildfire. <div> 
<div>For some processes, it would be more beneficial to use agent-based 
modeling (ABM) approach. For example, how an individual tree interacts with 
its surrounding environment, fighting for water and nutrients, should be 
possible to be implemented using the ABM.<div> 
<div>Other processes, such as animal behavior models, are also similar to 
ABM.<div> 
<div>The new question is: how can we merge the process-based model, or 
equation-based (EBM) with ABM in the Earth system model. What is more 
interesting is how can we make use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which ABM 
itself is based on, to optimize our model. <div> 
<div>To answer these questions, we need to understand the boundary between EBM 
and ABM and then we can design different processes using either approach. 
Eventually, we may have a hybrid model for our use.<div>
