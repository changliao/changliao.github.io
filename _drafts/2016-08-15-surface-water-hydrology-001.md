Both gage height and discharge rate are important factors in surface water 
hydrology. 
For most of the time they are closely coupled. 
When one of them is missing, we can always estimate the other using some 
relation algorithms. 
To date, there a few commonly used relation algorithms. For example:

Here are more materials:

Based on these relations, a simple test was run to illustrate and estimate the 
discharge based on gage height.

gage height-discharge data. The red crosses are calculated after "parameter 
estimation" using curve fitting method.
