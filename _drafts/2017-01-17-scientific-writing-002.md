I recently found a new way to prepare publication-ready high quality vector 
graphic using Google Drive. 
Here is the result:

width="662"></iframe> 

Here are steps you can follow: 

1. Prepare a Google sheets within Google Drive; 
1. Insert chart from the menu; 
1. Define whatever color or label you like; 
1. Use development tool within Google Chrome to find the SVG tag in the html 
script; 
1. Open your text editor and paste the SVG html tag into it; 
1. Make up the SVG header, remember to define the SVG version. 
1. Save the text file as a SVG file. 
1. You may want to convert the SVG file to a 
[Postscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript) (PS) file so you can 
convert it to any 600dpi raster figure. 
<div>The essential idea behind this is that [Google Chart 
API](https://developers.google.com/chart/) uses 
[SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) and we are 
basically calling Google Chart API to produce chart without actually writing 
any script!<div>The above figure is Copy right protected
