One of my recent projects is to develop a three-dimensional coupled water and 
carbon cycle ecosystem model. After finished the first version of the system, 
I wasn't quite satisfied with the system architecture, partly due to the 
complexity of the system dependency. 
<div> 
<div>In fact, I have spent great amount of time trying to design the system to 
be well-structured. Using class in C++11, I have defined many classes to 
controls different types of algorithms and processes. <div> 
<div>The interesting part of the story started to unveil when I started to 
write/revise the manuscript. When I tried to explain the conceptual model, I 
realized that even though the current system has use object-oriented 
programming (OOP) approach through class, most components within the system 
are not actually using the OOP concept at all. In a word, the system still 
acts like a process-oriented program.<div> 
<div>Taking a review of several other Earth system models (e.g., Community 
Land Model), I realized that unfortunately most of current models fall into 
this catalog, process-oriented instead of object-oriented system. <div> 
<div>Process-oriented system usually focuses on "action" instead of "object". 
For example, we focus on "photosynthesis" process but not the entry where it 
actually takes place. As this traditional approach is more intuitive to us, it 
usually causes problems in program development such as low reusability due to 
dependency. 

Another problem arises in my own research is that process-oriented approach 
cannot handle interactions between processes/objects very well, at least not 
as intuitive as they are supposed to be. In lots of times, we are looking into 
the relationship between different species, or more generally, types of 
objects or individuals. In this scenario, an object-oriented approach will 
significantly improve the readability and efficiency in model development. And 
usually it may simply help us to understand some scientific questions. 

In fact, in many fields (e.g., Artificial Intelligence) object-oriented 
approach is been widely used. In climate change, we are also using similar 
concepts such as "feedbacks" and "butterfly effects". However, we have not yet 
truly treat our Earth system as individual objects so far.
