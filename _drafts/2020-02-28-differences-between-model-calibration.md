Model calibration is the process of adjustment of the model parameters  and 
forcing within the margins of the uncertainties (in model parameters  and / or 
model forcing) to obtain a model representation of the  processes of interest 
that satisfies pre-agreed criteria  (Goodness-of-Fit or Cost Function).
