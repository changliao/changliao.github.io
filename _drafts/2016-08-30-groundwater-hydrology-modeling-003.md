Stream discharge is an important component in hydrology. Yet stream discharge 
is commonly studied in surface hydrology. In recent decades, it has been 
recognized that groundwater also interact with stream water throughout the 
year. 

In groundwater modeling, stream routing is explicitly modeled as a groundwater 
boundary condition. 
In general, several data are required for a successful simulation. Here I will 
only discuss a little bit related to water itself, to say, what kind of sink 
or source of the water in stream routing should be considered. 

First, a stream segment/reach may received upstream discharge. 

Second, a stream can also receive direct precipitation from the sky. But this 
term is usually omitted some the total amount may not be significant. 

Third, a stream may also lose water from evaporation. Similar to direct 
precipitation, this term is usually omitted as well. 

Forth, stream also receive later flow, it can be surface runoff and subsurface 
runoff (soil zone inter-flow). Many studies have shown that subsurface runoff 
account for more than 50% of the horizontal water flow. This term should be 
carefully estimated. However, surface runoff is also important during 
precipitation or snowmelt events. 

Fifth, groundwater upwelling or stream leakage. This is the process stream 
water gain or lose water. 

Below is an example of simulation stream discharge rates VS observed ones.

class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">So there are still 
some questions. <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: 
left;">First, in winter time, what should be well constrained since simulated 
discharge rates are much higher than observed rates?
