permalink: /publication/lateralflow2025
excerpt: 'Both lateral surface and subsurface water flow affect soil moisture dynamics, yet most land surface models only solve subsurface water movement vertically. Here we use a 3-D ecosystem model that considers both land surface and subsurface hydrologic processes to simulate soil moisture, which is then used to drive a 1-D vertical soil thermal model to simulate the soil moisture effects on soil thermal dynamics in central Alaska. Our coupled model improves soil temperature estimates by 43.5% in comparison with observational data. Soil moisture has little effect on soil temperature during the wet season (-1.5 %) and a substantial influence during the dry season (60%). Spatially, water lateral flow has significant impacts on both soil moisture and soil temperature, causing model estimates for thawed areas in the transition season to increase by ~10% in the study area. Our results highlight the importance of considering dynamical soil moisture, as well as lateral flow effects, on soil thermal dynamics in permafrost regions.'
